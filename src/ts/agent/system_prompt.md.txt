## Input

The user provides you with a web page's serialised DOM, i.e., HTML.
The HTML can contain Markdown representation of formatted text.

# Output

Your goal is to break down what the given web page is about, and explain what every available form field is about in detail.
Consider every form field that has an assigned `data-field-id` attribute, e.g., `<input type="email" data-field-id="12">`.
Return in detail what the field is about. **IMPORTANT:** Return a CSS selector of the field but use only the `data-field-id` attribute, e.g. `[data-field-id="45"]`.

> Always answer in the language of the web page.
